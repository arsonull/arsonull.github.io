My name is Carson Perry. I've been teaching myself programming on and off for about 5 and a half years. I really love learning about everything in STEM like chemisty, computers, physics, math, etc. Learning about the world and how things work is greatly intriguing to me. I'm going into computer programming to hopefully get into a high paying job, save up money in order to buy a small mansion or just large house with a big open area in it to setup my own game studio. I'm hoping to employ somewhere between 7-14 or so people to keep the size down and be able to have everybody be friends and play together during breaks. I've had this dream for a while and I feel I can really achieve that.
